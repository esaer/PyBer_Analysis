# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer analysis
The analyisis is to review how the ride sharing data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. The project is exectued through the following steps:
1. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
2. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results 

1. The total rides and total drivers in Urban areas are far more than the total rides and total drivers in Rural and Suburban Area
2. Average fare per ride and average fare per driver in Rural and Suburban areas are higher than in Urban area.
